# Linear CLI Integration

This project includes the `linear` CLI for managing Linear issues. Use it to create, update, and track issues during development.

## Quick Commands

Create issue (AI-powered):
```
linear agent "<description>" --auto
```

Update issue status:
```
linear issue update <ID> -s "in progress"
linear issue update <ID> -s done
```

Close issue:
```
linear issue close <ID>
```

Create git branch:
```
linear branch <ID>
```

List assigned issues:
```
linear issue list -a me
```

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `linear agent` with `--auto` flag for creating issues - it parses natural language automatically
- Include relevant context in issue descriptions: file names, function names, error messages
- Update issue status when starting (`in progress`) and completing (`done`) work
- Check `linear auth status` if commands fail

## Priority Reference

1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Medium, 4 = Low

## Example Workflows

Starting work on ABC-123:
```
linear issue update ABC-123 -s "in progress"
linear branch ABC-123
```

Found a bug:
```
linear agent "NPE in UserService.getProfile when profile is null, backend, high priority" --auto
```

Finished work:
```
linear issue close ABC-123
```
